The growth in \u201cbig data\u201d (characterized by high volumes, variety, and velocity of new data assets) together with the availability of low-cost storage and cloud-scale distributed compute technologies has led to an alternative approach to analytical data storage; the data lake. In a data lake, data is stored as files without imposing a fixed schema for storage. Increasingly, data engineers and analysts seek to benefit from the best features of both of these approaches by combining them in a data lakehouse; in which data is stored in files in a data lake and a relational schema is applied to them as a metadata layer so that they can be queried using traditional SQL semantics.</p> <p>In Microsoft Fabric, a lakehouse provides highly scalable file storage in a OneLake store (built on Azure Data Lake Store Gen2) with a metastore for relational objects such as tables and views based on the open source Delta Lake table format.
