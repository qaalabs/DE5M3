# Lab 05 - Create and use Dataflows (Gen2) in Microsoft Fabric

In Microsoft Fabric, Dataflows (Gen2) connect to various data sources and perform transformations in Power Query Online. They can then be used in Data Pipelines to ingest data into a lakehouse or other analytical store, or to define a dataset for a Power BI report.

*This lab is designed to introduce the different elements of Dataflows (Gen2), and not create a complex solution that may exist in an enterprise.*
